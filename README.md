# The X-Files

Exploration to the build interfaces of the current day.

Can we leverage some modern solutions to have easy, repeatable, platform-agnostic and maintainable
build environments? Can we perhaps even test them?

## Initial plan

The usual "old skool" ones:

- Script
- Makefile

The commonly referenced modern options:

- Justfile
- Magefile
- Earthfile
- Dagger
